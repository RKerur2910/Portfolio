    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Computer Engineering at California State University, Sacramento. I specialize in building intelligent, real-time systems at the intersection of software, hardware, and data. My experience spans software development, embedded systems and computer vision. As a Junior Developer at Arcasan Software, I optimized front-end performance and built scalable analytics dashboards using Flask, Java, and REST APIs. At SmartKnower, I developed machine learning models to uncover trends in large-scale financial data and supported strategic decisions through data analysis. During my time at Visual Securities, I configured secure IP-based surveillance networks for industrial settings, gaining hands-on exposure to networking and IoT infrastructure. I‚Äôm skilled in tools and languages like Python, C++, Java, Flask, SQL, and frameworks including Streamlit, Dash, Scikit-learn, and Dlib. My interests lie in computer vision, edge computing, and intelligent IoT systems, and I‚Äôm always looking for opportunities where I can blend creativity with engineering.</p>
